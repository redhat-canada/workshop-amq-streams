== Management and monitoring

This lab will be focused on:

* Instrumenting a cluster to support metrics
* Deploying Prometheus and Grafana
* Importing prebuilt Grafana dashboard definitions for Kafka and ZooKeeper.

While OpenShift uses Grafana and Prometheus internally, we need to use separate Prometheus and Grafana instances for our applications.
For this exercise, we will use an existing Prometheus and Grafana servers to monitor our AMQStreams clusters.

=== Cleaning up

Delete your target cluster from previous lab:

oc delete kafka/production-ready-target

oc delete KafkaMirrorMaker2/my-mm2-cluster

=== Instrumenting the Kafka cluster

We will reconfigure the `production-ready` cluster to advertise metrics.

----
oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RedHatWorkshops/workshop-amq-streams/master/configurations/clusters/production-ready-monitored.yaml
----

=== Installing Prometheus

To install Prometheus, we use the instructions of the Strimzi labs: https://strimzi.io/docs/0.11.1/#kafka_metrics_configuration

----
oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redhat-canada/workshop-amq-streams/master/configurations/metrics/prometheus.yaml
----

Then we create a route for the Prometheus service.
Make sure your project is set to 'amq-streams'.

----
oc expose svc prometheus
----

=== Opening Grafana

in your browser, go to the Grafana URL:
for this workshop:

http://grafana-demo.apps.cluster-mtl-e9a6.mtl-e9a6.example.opentlc.com/

User/Password:  admin/admin123

Go to the Strimzi Kafka dashboard
Select your namespace and cluster to monitor your kafka deployment.
